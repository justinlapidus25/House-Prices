Introduction
Predicting house prices is a common problem in the field of real estate and finance. Machine learning models can help in making accurate predictions based on various features of the houses. This project uses a dataset containing information about different houses, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, and more, to predict their sale prices.

Data Cleaning
Before building machine learning models, it's essential to clean the dataset. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, dropping redundant columns, and ensuring data consistency. In this project, we performed data cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Encoding Categorical Features
Categorical features, such as neighborhood or house style, need to be converted into a numerical format for machine learning algorithms. We used one-hot encoding to transform these features into binary columns, making them suitable for modeling.

Data Splitting
To build and evaluate machine learning models, the dataset was split into input features (X) and the target variable (y). X contains the features used to make predictions, and y contains the sale prices we aim to predict.

Machine Learning Models
This project explores various machine learning models to predict house prices. Different pipelines were created, including preprocessing steps such as scaling using StandardScaler, and models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Regressor were employed. The goal was to compare these models and identify the one with the lowest RMSE.

Feature Importance
Feature importance analysis using a Random Forest Regressor was performed to understand which features have the most significant impact on house prices. This analysis helps in feature selection and improving model accuracy.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides a structured approach to house price prediction using machine learning. While we have explored different models and preprocessing techniques, there is always room for further optimization and fine-tuning to enhance predictive accuracy. Future work may include experimenting with additional regression algorithms, feature engineering, and thorough cross-validation to assess model robustness.

This repository serves as a starting point for anyone interested in solving house price prediction problems and exploring the field of regression in machine learning. It provides a foundation for further research and model selection.
